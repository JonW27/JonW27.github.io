<!--ACTUAL CODE-->
1.<br>
Q: How many coulombs of charge are in one ampere-hour?<br>
A: \(1A = 1C/s\)<br>
Thus <b>60C</b>
<br>
2.<br>
Q: A flashlight contains a current of 0.12A for 65s. How much charge flows through the bulb in this time? How many electrons?<br>
A: \(1A = 1C/s\)
<br>
\(0.12A = 0.12C/s*65s\)
<br>\(4.87*{10^{19}}\)
<br><br>
8. Q: A silver wire is 4.5m long and is 0.45mm in diameter. What is its resistance?<br>
A:Explanation- we use the formula \(R=&rho;({{L} \over A})\), The length is given, the area can be found with the diameter, and &rho; can be found since the element is silver.<br>
Silver has resistivity of \(1.59*10^{-8}\).<br>
Answer is 1.41Ω.<br>
<br>
<br>
9. Q: When a potential difference of 18V is applied to a given wire, it conducts 0.35 A of current. What is the resistance of the wire?<br>
A: This is simple. \(R={{V} \over I}\). Substitute, and you should have \(R={{18V} \over 0.35}\)<br>R = 51.42Ω.<br><br>
19. Q: A 75-V generator supplies 3.3kW of power. How much current does the generator produce?<br><br>
A: Use the \(P= VI\) equation. Substitute and convert kW to W and you get the equation \(3300W = 75V*I\) = 44amps = 44A.<br><br>
20. Q: A portable CD player operates with a current of 24mA at a potential difference of 4.5V. What is the power usage of the player?<br>
A: Use P=VI again. Convert milli to regular. The answer is 0.11W.<br><br>
26. Q: Find the equivalent resistance between points A and B for the group of resistors shown in Figure 21-29.<br>
A: The diagram is not shown, but it is a parallel circuit with A on one side and B on the other side and two optional pathways, one of which contains a 35Ω resistor and 82Ω resistor and the other having a 45Ω resistor. 
The answer should be Equivalent Resistance equaling 31.7Ω.<br><br>
27. Q: What is the minimum number of 65Ω resistors that must be connected in parallel to produce an equivalent resistance of 11Ω or less?<br>
A: We are given the equivalence total which is 11 ohms or less. We need 6 65Ω resistors.<br><br>
46. Q: Find the magnitude and direction of the current in Figure 21-35.<br>
A: The direction is clockwise.
<br><br>
47. Q: Suppose the polarity of the 11.5V battery in Figure 21-35 was reversed? Do you expect this to increase or decrease the amount of current flowing in the circuit? Explain. (b) Calculate the magnitude and direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of the current in this case?<br> 
A: (a) decrease since the larger resistor will come first (b) the direction will be counterclockwise and the magnitude will be 0.12A.
<br><br>
53. Q: Find the equivalent capacitance between points A and B for the group of capacitors shown in Figure 21-39.<br>
A: Since it is a parallel circuit and capacitors just add up then 1/15 +1/30.2 = 21.
<br><br>
54. Q:
A: 0.46

$$e = {1.60 * {10 ^{-19}} C}$$<br>
$$m_{e} = {9.11 * {10 ^{-31}} kg}$$<br>
$$m_{p} = {1.673 * {10 ^{-27}} kg}$$<br>
$$m_{n} = {1.675 * {10 ^{-27}} kg}$$<br>
1 Coulomb\( = {6.25 * {10 ^{18}} }\) electrons<br>
Opposites attract so positive and positive repel, negative and negative repel, and positive and negative attract.
$$ 1µC = {10^{-6} C}$$<br>
Atoms that lose an electron become positive ions and atoms that gain an electron become negative ions since an electron is a negative charge. Thus because we can assume that 
both atoms started off neutral.<br>
Electrical polarization is when a negatively or positively charged object either touchs a neutral object or the neutral object is within the
charged object's electrical field. Since opposites attract, the oppositely charged charges will move toward the surface causing an attraction.<br>
Insulators are materials where charges are not free to move. Only the rubbed portion will be charged. Examples include amber.<br> Insulators are mostly nonmetalic.
Conductors allow charges to move freely and are usually metallic. Thus the charge will spread out all over the object and not stay in th rubbed area.<br>
Photoconductivity is a characteristic some objects have. When it is daytime the material conducts electricity and when it is night it becomes an insulator.<br>
Coulomb's Law: $$F = k*{{|q_{1}||q_{2)}|} \over r^{2}}.$$ The SI Unit is Newtons.
where \(k = 8.99 * 10^9 Nm^{2}/C^{2}\)
<br>
<a name="Superposition"><h3>Superposition</h3></a>
\(F_{net}\) is the vector sum of all forces due to charges. If you don't understand this then think of permutations. You find all the possible values and all possibilities that say start with the letter A will be 3, all with the letter B will be 2, and so on.
<br>
<a name="Chargedist"><h3>Charge Distributions</h3></a>
If a charge is evenly distributed on a sphere and the point particle is on the surface of the sphere then we can use the Force equation: Coulomb's law, as prior stated. However an easier way is to use 
the surface charge density in the equation \(Q = σA\). The SI unit would be \(C/m^{2}\).
<br>
<a name="TheElectricField"><h3>The Electric Field</h3></a>
The electric field is the distance outwards of a given point \(q_{0}\) in a perfect circle. Any object within that radius that is not the same charge as it will have an attraction.
This is given by \(\vec{E} = {\vec{F} \over q_{0}}\).
Electrodialysis purifies water using the fact that charges of opposite signs experience forces in different directions.
Thus, we can conclude: $$ E = {k*{|q| \over r_{2}}}$$
<a name="diagrams"><h3>Electric Field Diagrams</h3></a>
NaN. I'm too lazy to put up diagrams. Positives go outwards and negative goes inwards. And the double the charge the doublle the lines.
An electric dipole is when there are two separated opposite and equal charges. These will result in a net charge of 0, but retain their electric field.
<br>
<a name="Capacitors"><h3>Capacitors</h3></a>
In an ideal situation with Gauss's law two metal plates will be separated and within a certain distance, and one will have be negatively charged and the other positively charged as that the field points are perpendicular to the plate.
<br>
<a name="Epotential"><h3>Electric Potential</h3></a>
$$W = -q_{0}Ed$$
where d is displacement
$$ΔU = -W = q_{0}Ed$$
so as a result we can form the equation \(\vec{E} = {\vec{F} \over q_{0}}\) and \(ΔV = {ΔU \over q_{0}} = {-W \over q_{0}}\). The SI unit for these equations is
 joules/coulombs, or volts. Thus 1 J/C = 1 V.
$$1 eV = {(1.60 * 10^{-19}C)(1 V) = 1.60 * 10^{-19}J}$$
and
$$ E = -{ΔV \over Δs}$$
The SI Units being Volts/meter. 1 N/C = 1V/m.
Which means \(ΔV = {-EΔs}\).<br>
<a name="Econservation"><h3>Electric Conservation</h3></a>
Electricity is energy therefore it is also conserved. As a result we can express the following:
$${K_{A} + U_{A}} = {K_{B} + U_{B}}$$
Note that \(U = {qV}\).
Hence we can reach a simplified equation obeying conservation of energy as follows:
$${{1 \over 2}mv_{A}^{\ 2}} + {qV_{A}} = {{{1 \over 2}mv_{B}^{\ 2}} + {qV_{B}}}$$
We can set \(V_{A}\) to 0 if the particle starts from rest. We can conclude that decrease in electric potential energy means an increase in speed.
<br>Positive charges accelerate in the direction of decreasing electric potential.
<br>Negative charges accelerate in the direction of increasing electric potential.
<a name="Pointcharges"><h3>Electric Potential and Point Charges</h3></a>
See Cycle Formulas.
<br>
<a name="Equipotential"><h3>Equipotential Surfaces</h3></a>
  THe equipotentials are the contours on a contour map. As the distance from the origin increases, the distance between contours increases. NaN. Too lazy to show diagrams.
  $$V = {kQ \over R} = {kσ(4πR^{2}) \over R} = {4πkσR}$$
  For a sphere of radius R/2 it must have twice the charge density, 2σ, in order to match and have the same electric potential. Thus the charge density for a smaller sphere must be greater if it and a larger sphere have the same electric potential. This cross-applies to 
  electric fields. $$E = {kQ \over r^{2}} = {{kσ(4πR^{2})} \over R^{2}} = {4πkσ}$$
<a name="ElectricityHuman"><h3>Electricity in the Human Body</h3></a>
Electric waves in the human heart is detected with an instrument known as an electrocardiograph.<br>
Electrical activity in the brain can be detected and displayed with an electroencephalograph.<br>
0.5-3.5 Hz a.k.a. D waves are common during sleep.<br>
8-13 Hz a.k.a. a waves are common during relaxation.<br>
13 &lt; Hz a.k.a. b waves are common during alertness.<br>
<br>
<a name="Cycle"><h3>The Cycle Formulas</h3></a>
$$V = {{kq_{1}} \over r}$$
The cycle formulas are all those formulas that circle around.
\(V = {{kq_{1}} \over r}\)->\(V=Er\)->\(E = {{kq_{1}}\over r^{2}}\)->\(F={q_{0}E}\)->\(F={{kq_{1}q{0}} \over r^{2}}\)->\(U=Fr\)->\(U = {{Kq_{1}q_{0}} \over r}\)->\(U = q_{0}V\)->WHICH NOW COMES BACK TO THE FIRST EQUATION

<a name="tinspire"><h3>TI-nspire</h3></a>
I created a .tns file for TI-nspire with the variables on it so that you won't have to constantly refer to the reference table and consistently keep typing the long strings. It saves time.
<a href="https://github.com/JonW27/JonW27.github.io/blob/master/physjacked.tns?raw=true">Document with basic variables.</a>
<br>
To set up and get the document you should download the TI-nspire Computer Link software and connect your TI-nspire handheld by using its product ID which can be found in Settings, Status, and finally about. When you have that downloaded you can transfer the file from your downloads directory to your TI-nspire handheld.

$$e = {1.60 * {10 ^{-19}} C}$$<br>

1 Coulomb\( = {6.25 * {10 ^{18}} }\) electrons<br>
Opposites attract so positive and positive repel, negative and negative repel, and positive and negative attract.
$$ 1µC = {10^{-6} C}$$<br>
Atoms that lose an electron become positive ions and atoms that gain an electron become positive ions since an electron is a negative charge. Thus because we can assume that 
both atoms started off neutral.<br>
Electrical polarization is when a negatively or positively charged object either touchs a neutral object or the neutral object is within the
charged object's electrical field. Since opposites attract, the oppositely charged charges will move toward the surface causing an attraction.<br>
Insulators are materials where charges are not free to move. Only the rubbed portion will be charged. Examples include amber.<br> Insulators are mostly nonmetalic.
Conductors allow charges to move freely and are usually metallic. Thus the charge will spread out all over the object and not stay in th rubbed area.<br>
Photoconductivity is a product some objects have. When it is daytime the material conducts electricity and when it is night it becomes an insulator.<br>
Coulomb's Law: $$F = k*{{|q_{1}||q_{2)}|} \over r^{2}}.$$ The SI Unit is Newtons.
where \(k = 8.99 * 10^9 Nm^{2}/C^{2}\)
<br>
<a name="Superposition"><h3>Superposition</h3></a>
\(F_{net}\) is the vector sum of all forces due to charges. If you don't understand this then think of permutations. You find all the possible values and all possibilities that say start with the letter A will be 3, all with the letter B will be 2, and so on.
<br>
<a name="Chargedist"><h3>Charge Distributions</h3></a>
If a charge is evenly distributed on a sphere and the point particle is on the surface of the sphere then we can use the Force equation: Coulomb's law, as prior stated. However an easier way is to use 
the surface charge density in the equation \(Q = σA\). The SI unit would be \(C/m^{2}\).
<br>
<a name="TheElectricField"><h3>The Electric Field</h3></a>
The electric field is the distance outwards of a given point \(q_{0}\) in a perfect circle. Any object within that radius that is not the same charge as it will have an attraction.
This is given by \(\vec{E} = {\vec{F} \over q_{0}}\).
Electrodialysis purifies water using the fact that charges of opposite signs experience forces in different directions.
Thus, we can conclude: $$ E = {k*{|q| \over r_{2}}}$$
<a name="diagrams"><h3>Electric Field Diagrams</h3></a>
NaN. I'm too lazy to put up diagrams. Positives go outwards and negative goes inwards. And the double the charge the doublle the lines.
An electric dipole is when there are two separated opposite and equal charges. These will result in a net charge of 0, but retain their electric field.
<br>
<a name="Capacitors"><h3>Capacitors</h3></a>
In an ideal situation with Gauss's law two metal plates will be separated and within a certain distance, and one will have be negatively charged and the other positively charged as that the field points are perpendicular to the plate.
<br>
<a name="Epotential"><h3>Electric Potential</h3></a>
$$W = -q_{0}Ed$$
where d is displacement
$$ΔU = -W = q_{0}Ed$$
so as a result we can form the equation \(\vec{E} = {\vec{F} \over q_{0}}\) and \(ΔV = {ΔU \over q_{0}} = {-W \over q_{0}}\). The SI unit for these equations is
 joules/coulombs, or volts. Thus 1 J/C = 1 V.
$$1 eV = {(1.60 * 10^{-19}C)(1 V) = 1.60 * 10^{-19}J}$$
and
$$ E = -{ΔV \over Δs}$$
The SI Units being Volts/meter. 1 N/C = 1V/m.
Which means \(ΔV = {-EΔs}\).<br>
<a name="Econservation"><h3>Electric Conservation</h3></a>
Electricity is energy therefore it is also conserved. As a result we can express the following:
$${K_{A} + U_{A}} = {K_{B} + U_{B}}$$
This can be simplified to \(U = {qV}\)
<br>
<a name="Cycle"><h3>The Cycle Formulas</h3></a>
$$V = {{kq_{1}} \over r}$$
<a href="Error"><h3>Oh No! I messed up!</h3></a>
If such is the case send word via FB or @ seuvend@gmail.com.<br>
<a name="tinspire"><h3>TI-nspire</h3></a>
I'm working on a TI-nspire program right now to have all the functions. If I get it done I'll make the .tns publicly available so you can download it.

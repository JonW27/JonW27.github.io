      <h1>My Backstory</h1>
      <em>This story was inspired by <a href="http://lea.verou.me/2012/05/how-i-got-into-web-development-the-long-version/">Lea Verou's</a> own. You should read her blog too.</em>
      <h2>Beginnings</h2>
      <p>
	To understand where I'm from, you need to be given some basic context. I was born in Brooklyn, and moved to Queens before I was 1. My dad worked multiple jobs and my mother was a lone person dealing with several kids. <br><br>

	A culmination of those factors, others, and bullying in middle school lead to a depressive period. I felt like my life was completely out of my control, and that life was simply not very good.
<br><br>
My grades sorta suffered (we're talking relative terms) and I transferred schools. Transferring schools didn't help my grades or regain my sense or trust of other people however. Despite the best efforts of some really nice people (and teachers!), it felt like a downward trajectory.
<br><br>
Things changed though when the second semester of 7th grade I took a general "technology" class. I had fiddled with HTML  a little bit over the previous summer just randomly and had thought nothing of it. During the second quarter of the semester, I was introduced to a program called <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">scratch</a>. Scratch resolved the control issues I was feeling, letting me establish a sense of routine.<br><br>

Every single day, as soon as school ended, I would rush home, start the computer, turn the chair around exactly the same, and work 3+ hours on a scratch project. Most of what I created is pretty much forgettable, but to a middle school me, the fact that a program would do what I told or instructed it to do was completely revelatory. I would create things like <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10566526/">Warp Drive</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11829233/">Shadowland</a> which, despite the toll, time, and bugs, was something that *I built* that other people could appreciate.<br><br>

Schoolwise, CS was also something that was powering up my grades, so I resolved to learn more of it, before the actual class covered it. I learned HTML while we were doing Scratch, CSS while we were doing HTML, JS when we were doing CSS, and some XML and PHP when we were doing JS.<br><br>

By the time 8th grade had come around, I was no longer as depressed, my grades were up, and most importantly, I was feeling happier. I joined MOUSE Squad and started learning some shell commands (mostly it was messing with each other by auto-shutting down computers and remote-controlling them).
      </p>
      <h2>High School</h2>
      <p>
	My middle school was both a middle school and a high school, had U.S. news recognition, and pretty much guaranteed me a spot in the high school.<br><br>

	My parents, being the Asian parents that they are, had me fill out the NYC specialized high schools form and submit it to the guidance counselor. <br><br>

	I didn't really think about this too much in the beginning. Over the summer, while I did take SHSAT prep classes, I also was building a weebly <a href="http://paceacademy.weebly.com/">site</a> on US history that I somehow got my then friend to also work on too. I spent more time focusing on the CSS theming (circumventing the weebly wordmark at the bottom) and building things like a chat with firebase (learned from codeacademy when firebase wasn't owned by google) and google analytics dashboards (I was obsessed with increasing the number of views for my sites). I added things like google custom search,olark integration, and swiftype.<br><br>

	Nevertheless, I took the SHSAT, actually did pretty well on it (I remember coming out of long island city high school feeling pretty good). That was pretty much it.<br><br>

	The plan as my parents intentioned was for me to put a big three high school such as Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, or Brooklyn Technical High School first, with my middle school (BSGE) as backup if I couldn't get in.<br><br>

	The important thing to me though, was the fact that BSGE didn't offer an IB Computer Science track. There would be no more computer science classes for me to take. Stuyvesant, under Mike Zamansky, had created an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/nyregion/software-engineering-school-was-teachers-idea-but-its-been-done-citys-way.html">entirely mandatory CS program</a> that would become the model for other NYC schools looking to get CS in the curriculum.<br><br>

	When the little envelope arrived, and I realized that I got into Stuyvesant, I pretty much already knew my decision. My parents were happy too, so they got off my back for the summer.<br><br>

	I was not the rockstar that I thought was when I got to Stuyvesant. Overall, I think I did capital OK during HS. I bonded with friends over hate of the MTA, chess, hatred of certain teachers, and crappy grades. One of these friends would mention how the CS teachers were hosting something called a "hackathon" at SumAll. Since he wasn't going, and I didn't know anyone else, I didn't go.<br><br>

	Freshman year I discovered github, git, and how to setup github pages. I also learned how to use Redhat's openshift platform and created a pastebin called styx using php. I played my first cybersecurity CTF (stuyCTF) and did absolutely horrible (like only a few questions of what would be considered super easy), but was hooked.<br><br>

	Sophomore year CSTUY held their hackathon, defhacks, again, except this time at Facebook's headquarters. I still didn't know anyone, and my friend had other things to do, but this time I took a leap of faith. I showed up, felt completely out of my comfort zone, and being my anti-social self, just froze, not knowing what to do.<br><br>

	Luckily, I found someone I knew from math class, and joined them to build a project in Netlogo (what we were learning in class), a really troll-y project. Since the judges were stuy teachers, we got an honorable mention award (go bias lol).<br><br>

	After that hackathon, I took initiative for once in my life, and looked at NYHackathons, a site maintained by the awesome <a href="https://timsitorus.com/">Timotius Sitorus</a>, itself a hackathon project. General Assembly was hosting an AI hackathon in partnership with a company named Clarifai that piqued my interest.<br><br>

	This hackathon was completely different from the previous community-friendly one I had gone to before. Not only did I not have any serious AI skills, I didn't know anyone. Adults from all over NYC and the tristate area (including google engineers like <a href="https://mat.tc/">this guy</a>) were participating. This was a *serious* one.<br><br>

	Naturally, being the person that I am (clearly a very good team-former), I formed a team with the people most nearest to me (this is obviously the best way). Somehow, it turned out that at an artificial intelligence hackathon, I would be the only one with programming experience on the team (not even frontend).<br><br>

	Somehow it all worked out (thank you mentors), and we got a parody node.js facebook messenger chat bot of then-candidate for president Donald Trump (it used nlp and the clarifai ai image recognition api to namecall).<br><br>

	Winning this hackathon, for better or worse, hooked me on hackathons, and you can see all about it on the hackathon list. I'm not going to self-indulge on my masochistic tendency of choosing to spend my weekends in auditoriums with literally no sleeping accomodations working on projects before passing out.<br><br>

	Sophomore year was also the year when I took a python programming class, and built some cgi stuff. I progressed with CTFs and got hooked on steganography. Inspired by the humans.txt things that were going at the time (tumblr's still has <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/humans.txt">their's</a> up), I embedded a steganographic easter egg into my github image profile (I have no idea if it got removed in the uploading, but I digress) that led to various services and pages that I setup before ending (this would be where if I was a company or not broke, I would've put in something like a career link or some monetary reward). I was also pretty into talking up functional languages at the time which shows how arrogant I was.<br><br>

	Other highlights of CS at my high school included using selenium to scrape spanishdict to do my spanish hw (bs4 + requests is probably better), making my APUSH project on net neutrality (as a website), making my Senior English Paper also on  net neutrality, making my biology project a website to study for the final, and kinda being part of the school ZR team and specweb.

      <h2>College (otherwise known as present)</h2>
      <p>
	I did my composition paper on digital walled gardens and privacy, especially in regards to games.<br><br>
	I don't know where things go from here, but all it takes is *1* idea and boom. I've already failed so many times, it's gotta come sometime (Gambler's Fallacy). Honestly, all it takes is 1.

I really liked Ghost. I really did. But the fact of the matter is that it is, at its core, a CMS. A nice CMS, at that. But a CMS gives way to many potential attack vectors, that are just not possible on a static site. A CMS like Ghost requires consistent updating to stay up-to-date, which, unless you are willing to shell out money for Ghost Pro, simply is a blackhole for manhours.

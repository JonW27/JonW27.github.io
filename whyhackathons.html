                        <span>I</span> have attended 11 hackathons. For the majority, most people do not develop what they advertise– "revolutionary products", but instead rinse and repeat. This is a primary criticism, and the reason why there are sponsors out there who, in recent years, have not given out as much money to hackathons, as they have not achieved their desired results. However, this is above hackathons however, as hackathons are not meant for you to build a live real product, contrary to what some hackathon "demos" may make you believe, but rather to expose you to tech companies, network, and learn. Its a win for the companies as their brand is exposed, and its a win for you because you get to learn in a space with free food and other perks. </p>

                        As I attend more, I gain a sense of how to do things better– how to make things more efficient, and how to work on a deadline. My code and ability as a programmer increases when I feed off the energy off the others around me and get inspired by what they do. That's why the logical step (now) is PennApps. I have attended all 11 hackathons in my local area, the Tri-state area, and have yet to venture out farther. I think that my coding skill has matured enough so that I should go to a more big-time coding event, to see what's out there, and explore my boundaries– like you should too.

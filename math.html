<h2>Some PHYSICS Stuff</h2>
<h3>Electricity</h3>
$$e = {1.60 * {10 ^{-19}} C}$$<br>
$$m_{e} = {9.11 * {10 ^{-31}} kg}$$<br>
$$m_{p} = {1.673 * {10 ^{-27}} kg}$$<br>
$$m_{n} = {1.675 * {10 ^{-27}} kg}$$<br>
$$1 Coulomb = {6.25 * {10 ^{18}} electrons}$$<br>
Opposites attract so positive and positive repel, negative and negative repel, and positive and negative attract.
$$ 1Âµ = {10^{-6} C}$$<br>
Atoms that lose an electron become positive ions and atoms that gain an electron become positive ions since an electron is a negative charge. Thus because we can assume that 
both atoms started off neutral.<br>
Electrical polarization is when a negatively or positively charged object either touchs a neutral object or the neutral object is within the
charged object's electrical field. Since opposites attract, the oppositely charged charges will move toward the surface causing an attraction.<br>
Insulators are materials where charges are not free to move. Only the rubbed portion will be charged. Examples include amber.<br> Insulators are mostly nonmetalic.
Conductors allow charges to move freely and are usually metallic. Thus the charge will spread out all over the object and not stay in th rubbed area.<br>
Photoconductivity is a product some objects have. When it is daytime the material conducts electricity and when it is night it becomes an insulator.<br>
Coulomb's Law: $$F = k*{{|q_{1}||q_{2)}|} \over r^{2}}.$$ The SI Unit is Newtons.
where \(k = 8.99 * 10^9 Nm^{2}/C^{2}\)

$$V = {{kq_{1}} \over r}$$

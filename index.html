    <p>I'm a computer science student at Binghamton University, I primarily program in python and java. I've been doing more stuff with flutter and rust recently, and am excited about things like serverless and graphql.</p>
    <p>The fields I find most interesting are: cybersecurity, distributed systems, machine learning, and human computer interaction. I plan to update this site in the near future so be on the lookout for that.</p>
    <p>You can find some of my work on <a href="https://github.com/Jonw27">github</a> and <a href="http://jonathan.devport.co">devport</a>.</p>

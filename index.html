    <p>I'm a software engineer who works with a large set of technologies. You may have seen me before, at any of the 16 hackathons I attended in the NY-tristate area.</p>
    <p>I push code regularly, culminating in several projects that I put on <a href="https://github.com/Jonw27">github</a> and <a href="http://jonathan.devport.co">devport</a>.</p>    
    <p>I'm a high school student at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuyvesant_High_School">Stuyvesant</a>, one of the *top* ranked schools in the nation. Since I'm just a ween teen, I guess I'll have to prove that I'm for realz. Stuy's APCS course is AB and basically is all the coding entry-level interview stuff like stacks, trees, and heaps.</p>
        <p>I'm looking for work, like every other kid out there. Here's my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>

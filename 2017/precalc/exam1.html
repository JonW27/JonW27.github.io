            Equation forms:
        <ol>
            <li>slope-intercept: \(y=mx+b\)</li>
            <li>point-slope: \(y - y_1 = m(x-x_1)\)</li>
            <li>standard: \(y = ax + by + c\)</li>
        </ol>
        
        The \(\measuredangle\) of Inclination of a line is the \(\measuredangle\) of the line and the x-axis. It is measured counterclockwise from the x-axis to the line. \((0 \leq \theta < 180)\)
        The formula is<br>
        $$ m = tan( \theta) $$
        
        We need to brush up on our trigonometry. The tan addition formula is<br>
        $$ tan(A+B) = {tan(A) + tan(B) \over 1 - tan(A)*tan(B)} $$
        The tan subtraction formula is
        $$ tan(A-B) = {(tan(A) - tan(B) \over 1 + tan(A)tan(B)} $$
        
        Using the tan formulas we can delve into a proof with geometry that allows us to find the angle between two lines faster. The formula derived in the case that 2 non-perpendicular lines have slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ the acute $\measuredangle$ between the 2 lines is given by
        $$ tan(\theta) = \mid{(m_2-m_1)\over(1+m_1*m_2)}\mid $$
        Using the distance formula and tangent rules, we can again derive another formula. The distance d from the point $x_0,y_0$ to the line $y=mx+b$ is
        $$ d = {\mid mx_0+b-y_0\mid\over\sqrt{1+m^2}} $$
        We can apply this same formula to the standard form of an equation, and get the formula in the form of
        $$ d = {\mid Ax_0+By_0+C\mid\over \sqrt{(A^2+B^2)}} $$
        
        <h2>Conic Sections</h2>
        
        <b>Conic Sections-</b> A conic is the curve formed by the intersection of a plane and a double-mapped cone<br><br>
        
        <b>Circle-</b> The set of all points in the plane that are a given distance (radius) from a given point (center)
        <br>
        Equation of a Circle:
        $$ (x-h)^2+(y-k)^2 = r^2 $$
        where $(h,k)$ is the center.
        The <b>circumcenter</b> is the point of concurrency for the circle (i.e. where the $\perp$ bisectors intersect)

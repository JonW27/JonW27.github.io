        The two line segments that join the foci of an ellipse to a point on an ellipse are called <b>focal radii</b>.
        The distance from the first focus to the point is represented by the equation $$ d_1 = a + ex_0$$ The distance from the second focus to the point can be represented in a similar fashion. $$ d_2 = a - ex_0 $$
        Ellipses can be defined as the set of points P whose distances to the focus and the directrix are in a fixed ration between 0 and 1. The equation of the directrices can be found with the following equation: $$ x \text{ (or y)} = (-) {a\over e} $$ The equation of the <b>tangent</b> line to the ellipse ${x^2\over a^2} + {y^2\over b^2} = 1$ at the point $P(x_1,y_1)$ is equal to $${x_1x\over a^2} + {y_1y\over b^2} = 1$$ Similar to a parabola, an ellipse has reflectve properties. In this case, if a ray leaves one of the foci and collides with a point of on the ellipse, it will reflect off and pass through the other focus.<br><h2>Hyperbolas</h2>Definition: The set of all points in the plane, the absolute value of the differences of whose distances from two fixed points is a positive constant. Each fixed point is called a focus.<br><br><b>Transverse Axis-</b> the line segment that joins the two vertices.<br><b>Conjugate Axis-</b> the line segment that is perpendicular to the transverse axis and extends a distance b on either side of the center of the hyperbola. <br><br>Also note, $$ |PF_1-PF_2| = 2a $$ The absolute value is something that should be especially noted. The equation for a hyperbola with a horizontal focal axis is $$ {x^2\over a^2} - {y^2\over b^2} = 1$$ The equation for a hyperbola with a vertical focal axis is $${y^2\over a^2} - {x^2\over b^2} = 1$$ As for values for vertices, foci, etc. the values go in the x position generally for horizontal and vice versa. The equation of the asymptotes for horizontal is $y = \pm {b \over a}x$ and vice versa for vertical. The same rules apply for off-centered hyperbolas. The only thing to note regarding these is that the equations of the asymptotes are in point-slope form such that they form an equation like $y-k=\pm{b\over a}(x-h)$. In order to find the equation of the hyperbola given the asymptotes is to generally graph it and find the quadrant.<br> The latera rectum of a hyperbola has the length ${2b^2 \over a}$ and the endpoints change opposite to how the regular value shifting works. E.g. $(h \pm c, k \pm {b^2 \over a}) $ and vice versa. <br>Focal radii for a hyperbola are the same as for an ellipse, with the exception being that you always take the absolute value of the expression. <br>The equation of the tangent is also the same with the exception being that it is minus, that is, it is ${x_1x\over a^2} - {y_1y\over b^2} = 1$ <br>Finally, hyperbolas also have reflective properties. A ray that starts from one focus, will reflect off the hyperbola in a direction that goes directly away from the other focus. A ray directed to one focus, will reflect in the direction of the other focus (outside).
